# Machine Learning and Statistics
## Machine Learning and Statistics Repository for Post Grad Data Analytics - ATU
#### Gerry Donnelly - Winter 2022

### Introduction
This repository contains all of the noteboks and associated files for this course module. The module is an introduction to Machine Learning(ML) and ML relevant statistical methods. 

### Summary of the Repository
The repository consists of 2 folders described as follows:
1. **ml_practicals.**
   This folder contains 4 jupyter notebooks, each exploring specific aspects of the the statistical methods underpinning machine learning and an images folder. 
   
   The notebooks are as follows:
   - *ml_stats_hypothesis_practicals.ipynb*
     
        An introduction to Hypothesis Testing, a statistical method to test assumptions about populations.

   - *ml_stats_parameters_practicals.ipynb*

        Looking at Linear Regression and methods to fit optimum function parameters to accurately represent relationships between dependant and independant variables.

   - *ml_stats_practicals_models.ipynb*

        Introduction to mathematical models and how the real world can be represented using maths and mathematical equations. 

   - *ml_stats_machinelearning.ipynb*
        Introduction to the concepts f=of machine learning, neurons and the tensorflow / keras packages.
   
   The images folder contains graphics that are used in the notebooks. 

2. **ml_project.**
    This folder contains a single notebok that describes in detail and in code a machine learning program for anomaly detection in time series data using tensorflow and keras.
    
    - ml_evaluation.ipynb
