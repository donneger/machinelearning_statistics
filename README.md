# Machine Learning and Statistics
## Machine Learning and Statistics Repository for Post Grad Data Analytics - ATU
#### Gerry Donnelly - Winter 2022

### Introduction
This repository contains all of the noteboks and associated files for this course module. The module is an introduction to Machine Learning(ML) and ML relevant statistical methods. 

### Summary of the Repository
The repository consists of 2 folders described as follows:
1. **ml_practicals.**
   This folder contains 4 jupyter notebooks, each exploring specific aspects of the the statistical methods underpinning machine learning and an images folder. 
   
   The notebooks are as follows:
   - *ml_stats_hypothesis_practicals.ipynb*
     
        An introduction to Hypothesis Testing, a statistical method to test assumptions about populations.

   - *ml_stats_parameters_practicals.ipynb*

        Looking at Linear Regression and methods to fit optimum function parameters to accurately represent relationships between dependant and independant variables.

   - *ml_stats_practicals_models.ipynb*

        Introduction to mathematical models and how the real world can be represented using maths and mathematical equations. 

   - *ml_stats_machinelearning.ipynb*
        Introduction to the concepts f=of machine learning, neurons and the tensorflow / keras packages.
   
   The images folder contains graphics that are used in the notebooks. 

2. **ml_project.**
    This folder contains a single notebok that describes in detail and in code a machine learning program for anomaly detection in time series data using tensorflow and keras.
    
    - ml_evaluation.ipynb  
  
3. Requirements to run the notebooks.
   
   The following are the pre-requisites to run the notebook:

    The notebook can be found at this link in Github.
        *https://github.com/donneger/machinelearning_statistics*

    Download the notebook using the Download ZIP and extract the files to a folder on your PC.

    Ensure the following packages are installed on your PC

    - Jupyter  
    - numpy
    - pandas  
    - matlplotlib   
    - scipy.stats  
    - tensorflow 

    If these packages are not intalled it is recommended to install Ananconda, instructions on installation can be found [***here***](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html), as this has most of the commononly used Python packages, including those listed above.

    Alernatively they can be installed individually using pip install.

    Open a Jupyter notebook (or Jupyter Lab) session on your PC, open and run the file random.ipynb.

    All of the assignment text and code is contained in the notebook, it will run thorugh from start to finish with no user input needed.

    Additional information on tensorflow and keras can be found at the links below.
